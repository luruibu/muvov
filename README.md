- **No Metadata Collection**: No tracking of who you talk to, when, or how often
- **Complete Data Sovereignty**: You own and control 100% of your communication data

### 🔐 End-to-End P2P Encryption
- **Direct Peer Connection**: Messages travel directly between devices using WebRTC's built-in encryption (DTLS/SRTP)
- **No Intermediary Servers**: Data never passes through third-party servers that could intercept or log communications
- **Real-time Encryption**: All messages, files, and calls are encrypted in transit using industry-standard protocols
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each session uses unique encryption keys that cannot decrypt past communications

### 🏠 Local-First Data Model
- **Device-Only Storage**: All chat history, contacts, and settings stored exclusively on your local device
- **No Cloud Sync**: Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it with a peer
- **Encrypted Local Storage**: Even local data can be encrypted with user-defined passwords
- **Selective Data Sharing**: You choose exactly what data to share and with whom

### 🚫 Privacy  Protection Features
- **No Phone Numbers Required**: Connect using anonymous Peer IDs instead of personal identifiers
- **No Account Registration**: No email, phone, or personal information required to use the system
- **Ephemeral Connections**: Peer connections can be temporary and leave no permanent traces
- **Network Traffic Obfuscation**: P2P traffic appears as standard WebRTC data, not identifiable as messaging

### 🔄 Decentralized Architecture Benefits
- **No Single Point of Failure**: No central server to be hacked, shut down, or compromised
- **Censorship Resistant**: Cannot be blocked by governments or ISPs targeting specific servers
- **Global Availability**: Works anywhere with internet access, no regional server dependencies
- **Self-Sovereign Network**: Each user contributes to and benefits from the decentralized network
